Files description:
      hfc1test_schema_CHARM.sql:  CHARM schema. CHs schema added to the one from SMART.
      ch_observatory.csv: file with the data entry for the observatory table. 
      ch_frc.csv: file with the feature detection code info.
      ch_observation.csv: file with the fits headers info of the images used.
      ch_groups.csv: file with the groups of CHs.  Each CH belongs to a group

Tested  and  when data is loaded doesn't give errors.  However, the
links are losed.  When loaded charm results it links the table with
data wrongly, it doesn't change the identifiers.

trying load data with set
load data local infile 'ch_result2.csv' into table CORONALHOLES (OBSERVATION_ID_EIT, @var1, OBSERVATION_ID_MDI, @var2) set OBSERVATION_ID_EIT = (select ID from observations where observations.filename = @var1) OBSERVATION_ID_MDI = (select ID from observations where observations.filename = @var2) fields terminated by ';' IGNORE 1 LINES ;
